This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A simple app to demonstrate the requirements of the challenge.

- Checkout the project and run npm install
- Run npm start
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000
- Select the numbers you want on the ticket.
- Click on 'Create Ticket'
- Click on 'Draw'
- The ball draw will draw number in 2sec intervals.

Note: This is purely a front end app. No persistance layer is used. On page refresh all the data is lost.
